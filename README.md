# Carlos Semeao | Linux & DevSecOps Apprentice ⚙️🔐

I build and document real-world labs focused on **Linux hardening**, **Ansible automation**, and **secure remote access**.  
Each repository demonstrates infrastructure control, privileged access enforcement, and automation precision — aligned with **remote-ready DevSecOps roles**.
